# Introduction
Why start a dumb blog in a world brimming with social media and opportunities to monetize your words? It's a fair question, but I think the dumb-appeal of it is exactly what matters to me. These thoughts and words you are reading right now are effectively as pure as I can make them. This website comes equipped with no trackers, no advertisements, no SEO tools, no algorithms, no like button, no comments section, and no memberships. It is little more than a journal of things I find interesting. You, reader, have to work to find this page, scroll through a list of my ideas, and choose to read one.

In today's world of the dead internet, an island like this, where I have no obligation or motive to write, where you can find my non-large-language-model generated words, may have more value than ever before.
